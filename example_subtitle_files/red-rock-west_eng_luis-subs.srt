1
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,977
Mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Johnson.

2
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:19,109
- Mr. Johnson.
- Back here.

3
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,746
This is the guy I was telling you about,
my friend from Texas.

4
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,448
Yeah.

5
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:26,620
- Howard, get him an application.
- Sure.

6
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,060
Sit anywhere you like.

7
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:44,535
- You said I already had the job.
- It's just a formality.

8
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,738
- You want some coffee?
- Sure.

9
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:48,775
- Black, right?
- Right.

10
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:06,024
Jim, I don't need to tell you
how dangerous it is out there.

11
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:08,292
The guy has a fucked-up leg.

12
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,094
If you were me, would you hire him?

13
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:14,399
Give the guy a break.
He drove 1,200 miles.

14
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:16,199
He's too big a risk.

15
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,235
I'll lose my insurance.

16
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:19,771
Michael, wait.

17
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,741
Mike, why did you tell him about your leg?

18
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,910
He'd have found out sooner or later.

19
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,579
So what? By then you'd have had the job.

20
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,581
That wouldn't be right.

21
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,116
Shit.

22
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:38,356
I'm really sorry about this.

23
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:40,927
Don't worry about it, Jim.
It's not your fault.

24
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:45,063
Now what will you do?

25
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,802
I don't know. Maybe I'll rob a bank.

26
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,169
- You need some money?
- That's okay.

27
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,472
- I'll spot you a couple bucks.
- Don't worry about me.

28
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:56,274
I'll be all right.

29
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,878
You stay in touch.

30
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:02,414
Yeah. You too.

31
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:07,013
Anybody here?

32
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,697
Is anybody here?

33
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:33,738
Hello.

34
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:41,548
I said, is anybody here?

35
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,677
- Can I help you?
- I need some gas.

36
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,915
- Fill her up?
- No, just five dollars' worth.

37
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,982
Texas, huh?

38
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,918
What in the devil brings you
out here to Wyoming?

39
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:24,458
- I'm looking for work.
- What kind of work are you looking for?

40
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:28,960
I hoped to get on a drilling crew.

41
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,928
Roughneck, huh?

42
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:33,531
Why don't you try Red Rock?

43
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:35,967
About 50 miles down the road.

44
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,069
There's a bar there called The Red Rock.

45
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,838
Most of the local crew hangs out there.

46
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:44,578
Hell, maybe somebody there
can head you in the right direction.

47
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:48,846
Mighty fine old car you got here.

48
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:53,655
You know, they just don't
make them that way anymore.

49
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:56,789
That will be five dollars.

50
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:01,927
Five it is.

51
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:05,597
Thank you.

52
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,901
- You open?
- Yeah.

53
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,037
- Got any coffee?
- Yeah.

54
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:12,323
Thanks.

55
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:23,069
You were supposed to be here last Friday.

56
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:27,306
I was beginning to think
I'd have to find somebody else.

57
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,278
You are here for the job, aren't you?

58
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:44,391
- You must be Wayne?
- Yes.

59
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:47,259
And you're Lyle from Dallas?

60
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,830
- Right.
- Good.

61
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,437
Now just take your coffee
and let's go in the office.

62
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,850
There's the five like we agreed.

63
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,622
I'll have the other five
ready for you when it's...

64
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:20,460
when it's done.

65
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:33,874
Today is Tuesday, so she'll be
out riding most of the day.

66
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:42,079
The best way to do this is
to make it look like a simple burglary.

67
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,082
Just go out to the house...

68
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,452
break in...

69
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:49,920
and...

70
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,592
mess the place up a little.

71
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:58,866
Not too much. Just enough.

72
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:02,099
And...

73
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:09,276
And then when she comes in, you...

74
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,616
You know what to do.

75
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,323
Thanks.

76
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:36,268
I figure the cops will spend
a couple months looking for clues.

77
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:39,703
Once they come up empty-handed,
they'll get frustrated...

78
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:42,039
and, eventually...

79
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:47,144
they'll try to blame some drifter
passing through town.

80
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:51,051
- It happens all the time, you know?
- Yeah.

81
00:13:59,823 --> 00:14:03,530
Who is she?

82
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:08,969
She's my wife.

83
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:10,723
Your name Suzanne?

84
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:27,774
You're married to Wayne, right?

85
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:39,149
I don't know how to tell you this,
but your husband, Wayne...

86
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,088
he plans to have you murdered.

87
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:46,424
Is this a joke?

88
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:49,395
I'm afraid not.

89
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,035
He paid me to do it.

90
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:03,410
- What will you do?
- I don't know.

91
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,678
I hate to see an innocent woman
get hurt...

92
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:10,418
but it's an awful lot of money.

93
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:18,123
Can I fix you a drink?

94
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:30,070
You're taking this a lot better
than I thought you would.

95
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:35,172
Have you ever been married?

96
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:37,443
- What?
- What's your name?

97
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:41,812
Lyle.

98
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:44,082
Have you ever been married, Lyle?

99
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:49,455
It does strange things to people.

100
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,163
Suppose I double his offer,
and you do something for me?

101
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,635
What?

102
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:07,239
Take care of Wayne.

103
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:01,024
- Is that all?
- That will do it.

104
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:03,595
How much gas you have?

105
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:05,865
Twenty-nine dollars.

106
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,234
119.78.

107
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:17,577
- You got anything smaller?
- Not today.

108
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,915
Hello?

109
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:25,098
Hang in there, buddy.
I'll get you out of here.

110
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,815
- Get a doctor!
- What happened?

111
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:46,720
- Somebody get a fucking doctor!
- Wait here, sir.

112
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:51,290
Dr. Smoot. ER, stat.

113
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,692
- What happened?
- I hit him with my car.

114
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,595
- Bobby! When?
- About 20 minutes ago.

115
00:22:57,695 --> 00:23:00,364
- Weak pulse. Get him into the ER.
- Right away.

116
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:03,401
Wait here. I'll need
to ask you some questions.

117
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,203
This way, sir.

118
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:15,213
Are you finished yet?

119
00:23:16,948 --> 00:23:18,716
No. Have you heard anything?

120
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:22,657
Sorry. You'll have to wait for the doctor.

121
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:37,101
Wait.

122
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:42,006
I was going to move my car.
How's he doing?

123
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,041
It's good you brought him in when you did.

124
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:46,078
He lost a lot of blood.

125
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:50,848
Hi, Doc. Is this the guy
that brought him in?

126
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:54,488
Yeah. Matt, can I talk to you?

127
00:23:58,122 --> 00:24:02,293
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah, my car is out there.

128
00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:05,499
It's in the red zone. I was gonna move it.

129
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:08,566
- Yeah?
- That was the sheriff.

130
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,603
He's on his way over.

131
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:17,142
- Did you call him?
- What do you think?

132
00:24:18,476 --> 00:24:21,815
- You got some ID on you?
- Yeah.

133
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:25,851
Is there a problem, Officer?

134
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:28,619
Yeah.

135
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:32,890
Looks like we have
an attempted homicide on our hands.

136
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,225
What are you talking about?
It was an accident.

137
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:38,532
Then how do you explain these?

138
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,567
He's been shot twice in the stomach.

139
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:20,204
How is Kurt doing?

140
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:24,408
He's pretty bad off,
but the doctor says he'll make it.

141
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:27,881
If there's any change in his condition,
let me know.

142
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:33,418
"Michael Williams."

143
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:37,355
You'll be spending some time with us...

144
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:40,191
until we can get to the bottom of this.

145
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:43,798
Wayne, can I talk to you for a minute?

146
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:49,367
You're gonna hold this guy?

147
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:52,937
- You got somebody else?
- No, but it doesn't make sense...

148
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:55,840
he'd shoot him,
then bring him to the hospital.

149
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,110
Yeah. Well, Odessa, Texas.
That's not too far.

150
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,383
We can just get him on the phone
if we have any questions.

151
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:07,852
You and Russ impound the car.
I'll take him to the station.

152
00:26:07,952 --> 00:26:09,388
Yes, sir.

153
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:13,358
Get in.

154
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,505
All right, kid.

155
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:31,612
Start talking. You have two minutes
to tell me what is going on.

156
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:35,179
I thought you needed a stupid bartender.

157
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,316
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not.

158
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:42,553
- Who else knows about this?
- Nobody.

159
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:45,956
I said, don't fuck with me!

160
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:47,626
I'm not.

161
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:58,502
What about the guy in the hospital?
What happened?

162
00:26:58,602 --> 00:27:01,505
I don't know anything about that.

163
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:04,208
You don't have to worry.
I won't say anything to anyone.

164
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:08,179
- What about the money?
- It's in my car glove compartment.

165
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,116
Good.

166
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:14,518
So, what do you think?

167
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:17,621
Why don't you just drop me off...

168
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,558
and we'll both forget the whole thing.

169
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:06,118
What the fuck are you doing?

170
00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:14,992
- My car broke down.
- Where? I don't see a car.

171
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:18,131
- It's just over that ridge.
- Over that ridge, huh?

172
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:21,701
You're one lucky son of a bitch.

173
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,903
If I hadn't just had my brakes done...

174
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:28,273
I'd be picking your brains
out of my radiator.

175
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:32,444
- Fuck.
- Listen, I hate to ask you this...

176
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:34,414
but could you give me a ride?

177
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,656
I don't know. Are you dangerous?

178
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:55,199
I just need a ride. You can drop me off
at the nearest gas station.

179
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:57,735
Okay, cowboy, you got yourself a ride.

180
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,505
Get in.

181
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,096
Son of a bitch.

182
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,475
You banged it up pretty good.
How'd you do that?

183
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:37,777
- I was in the Marine Corp.
- No shit?

184
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,481
First Forest Recon.

185
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:46,584
Last unit to leave Vietnam. April of '71.

186
00:32:46,684 --> 00:32:48,621
I got the same one right here.

187
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:51,889
Where were you stationed?

188
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:54,126
I was with the 24th in Lebanon.

189
00:32:56,827 --> 00:32:58,729
The truck bomb thing... You were there?

190
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:00,832
Yeah.

191
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,171
Holy shit! Were you
in that building they hit?

192
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:10,408
Damn! You are one lucky son of a bitch.

193
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:12,743
I know!

194
00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:14,978
I mean, I know I'm lucky.

195
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,182
241 guys weren't.

196
00:33:20,752 --> 00:33:24,559
- Thanks for the ride.
- Anytime, soldier.

197
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,818
Are you going in here?

198
00:33:54,918 --> 00:33:57,555
Yeah, I got to take care
of some business...

199
00:33:57,655 --> 00:33:59,224
and I want to buy you a drink.

200
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,126
Thanks, but I should get going.

201
00:34:02,226 --> 00:34:04,962
I nearly greased your can back there.

202
00:34:05,062 --> 00:34:08,299
Now, the least I can do is buy you a beer.

203
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,702
Thanks, but I should get my car.

204
00:34:10,802 --> 00:34:12,737
I'll tell you what.

205
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:16,076
Let me buy you a beer,
and then I'll help you get your car.

206
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:21,879
That's okay. You've done enough already.

207
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:24,918
Now I said I'd help you get your car.

208
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:27,619
Really, it's okay.

209
00:34:29,052 --> 00:34:30,989
You don't want to drink with me?

210
00:34:32,055 --> 00:34:33,891
I'm not good enough to buy you a beer?

211
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:36,361
No, it's not that.

212
00:34:36,461 --> 00:34:39,564
Then what the fuck's your problem?

213
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:41,601
Us Marines got to stick together.

214
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:44,703
Come on!

215
00:34:46,136 --> 00:34:49,840
- Okay, soldier. I can get my car later.
- That's it.

216
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,877
Now, that's more like it.

217
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:55,816
All right. Come on.

218
00:35:06,357 --> 00:35:08,025
What'll you have?

219
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,763
I'd like a shot of Jim Beam
and a bottle of Bud.

220
00:35:11,763 --> 00:35:15,567
- How about you?
- The same.

221
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:18,936
You know,
that never should have happened...

222
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:22,540
what happened to you
and our boys over there in Lebanon.

223
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,714
You get in there,
you just gotta give it your best shot.

224
00:35:28,746 --> 00:35:30,181
Right.

225
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:37,622
That will be 6.50.

226
00:35:39,457 --> 00:35:43,494
You got a guy here named Wayne?

227
00:35:43,594 --> 00:35:46,063
- You mean the owner?
- Yeah, that's him.

228
00:35:46,163 --> 00:35:48,366
Wayne Brown.

229
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:50,435
- Sorry, he's out.
- Damn.

230
00:35:50,535 --> 00:35:54,405
He's probably out looking for me.
I was supposed to be here last week.

231
00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:56,608
I can call him...

232
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,276
if it's important.

233
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:00,879
Would you? I'd appreciate that.

234
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:04,282
Tell him Lyle from Dallas
finally showed up.

235
00:36:04,382 --> 00:36:07,752
- He'll know who you mean.
- Sure thing.

236
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:10,122
I never did catch your name.

237
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,260
- It's nice meeting you, Michael.
- Likewise.

238
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,597
Listen, I have to use the head.
I'll be right back.

239
00:36:19,697 --> 00:36:22,536
Yeah, well, don't piss on the seat,
even if they did.

240
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:25,103
It's not lucky.

241
00:37:01,906 --> 00:37:04,544
Did you just pick somebody up
outside of town?

242
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:09,146
- Yeah, I did.
- Where is he?

243
00:37:09,246 --> 00:37:12,318
Now, Wayne, why would you be inquiring?

244
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:29,701
You check out back that way.
I'll go over here.

245
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:31,471
He can't have gotten too far.

246
00:38:37,702 --> 00:38:41,743
I'm not going to Sheridan to see a bitch
with a pissed-off husband.

247
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:50,481
- I can't get to Sheridan till next week.
- Twenty bucks.

248
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:53,920
I'll tell you something.
The first sign of bullshit...

249
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:13,473
Give me the goddamn suitcase.

250
00:40:13,564 --> 00:40:14,999
God!

251
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:23,407
Does that tickle?
'Cause it won't if I pull the trigger.

252
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,443
What the hell are you doing on my truck?

253
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:27,778
Sorry, boss. I didn't mean to scare you.

254
00:40:27,878 --> 00:40:31,418
Hey, do I look scared to you?

255
00:40:34,752 --> 00:40:37,088
I was trying to ditch my old lady.

256
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:38,823
You were what?

257
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:42,260
She caught me in the bar,
and I wasn't supposed to be there.

258
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,764
- She started sprouting horns and shit.
- Bullshit.

259
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:49,867
Look at that uncontrolled
response to bullshit.

260
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:52,170
- I hate when that happens.
- Yeah, I don't like it either...

261
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,438
but I had to get out of there.

262
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:57,942
- So you climbed up on my truck?
- Yeah.

263
00:40:58,042 --> 00:40:59,544
Isn't that kind of stupid?

264
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:02,880
Yeah, it is, but you've never met my wife.

265
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,952
- She's spooky.
- Yeah?

266
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:10,454
You're lying to me. Get off my truck.

267
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,491
Come on, get off the truck.

268
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:15,728
Oh, man.

269
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,370
- I'm headed north if you want a ride.
- Thanks.

270
00:41:35,112 --> 00:41:37,148
There's a ranch just up the road.

271
00:41:37,248 --> 00:41:39,850
You can drop me off there.

272
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,657
What's the deal? Am I taking you
back to or away from your old lady?

273
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:49,794
Neither. Actually, I have
a little business to take care of.

274
00:41:49,894 --> 00:41:51,329
Business?

275
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:54,533
Is she pretty?

276
00:41:57,735 --> 00:41:59,672
Yeah, she is pretty.

277
00:42:10,548 --> 00:42:11,983
Good luck, Spider-Man.

278
00:42:13,484 --> 00:42:14,919
Thanks for the ride.

279
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:09,473
It's okay. It's all right.

280
00:43:09,573 --> 00:43:11,509
I'm not who you think I am.

281
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:13,044
I lied.

282
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:16,947
I needed a job real bad.

283
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:20,718
Your husband offered me one,
and I took it before I knew what it was.

284
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:23,623
- You're not a killer.
- That's right.

285
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:27,858
But the guy I'm supposed to be
just drove into town.

286
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:31,829
- You have to get out of here.
- Suddenly my life's in danger again?

287
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:33,731
That's right.

288
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:35,599
You expect me to believe you?

289
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:38,303
What is this? You want my money?
I don't have any more money.

290
00:43:38,403 --> 00:43:40,137
Get the fuck out of my house!

291
00:43:40,237 --> 00:43:42,606
You're not listening to me.

292
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:45,978
Your friend, the ranch hand,
has been shot!

293
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:52,650
- You mean Kurt?
- Yeah.

294
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,852
- What happened?
- I don't know.

295
00:43:54,952 --> 00:43:57,221
He was lying in the road,
and I took him to the hospital.

296
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:59,257
Pack your bags and get going.

297
00:43:59,357 --> 00:44:00,925
- Is he alive?
- Yeah.

298
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:04,228
- They know who shot him?
- No, he was unconscious.

299
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:08,403
I wouldn't be surprised if your husband
had something to do with it, would you?

300
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,945
Get dressed.

301
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:36,160
He's in the living room.
Now go to the balcony.

302
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,696
Come on.

303
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:33,411
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

304
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:37,952
- What should I do?
- If I were you, I'd get a divorce.

305
00:46:43,355 --> 00:46:44,822
- Where you going?
- I don't want to be here...

306
00:46:44,922 --> 00:46:47,594
when Lyle from Dallas wakes up, do you?

307
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,141
There's a jeep behind the barn.

308
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:06,178
Let me grab a coat. I'll be right out.

309
00:47:31,168 --> 00:47:33,606
The fucking story of my life.

310
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:38,976
- What kind of mileage does this get?
- Why?

311
00:47:39,076 --> 00:47:41,614
We're almost out of gas.

312
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:54,292
- Which way is the nearest town?
- Medicine Bow is 40 miles that way.

313
00:47:54,392 --> 00:47:58,062
- Is there a sheriff there?
- Yes.

314
00:47:58,162 --> 00:47:59,863
Are you going to the police?

315
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:04,304
Yeah, I want to get this mess cleaned
before anyone else gets hurt.

316
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:07,171
What will you tell them?

317
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:10,240
The truth.

318
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:14,178
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure about that.

319
00:48:14,278 --> 00:48:17,214
How will you explain
impersonating a hired killer...

320
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:19,385
and taking $10,000
from my husband, the sheriff?

321
00:48:24,888 --> 00:48:27,191
What do you suggest?

322
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:30,227
I suggest we get as far away from here
as possible.

323
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:34,532
- You're just gonna leave?
- Yeah.

324
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:37,904
What the hell do I have
that's worth coming back for?

325
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,879
Russ, give me the registration.

326
00:48:50,648 --> 00:48:53,217
- Son of a bitch got away.
- What?

327
00:48:53,317 --> 00:48:56,086
Yeah, he kicked me. He went berserk.

328
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,123
Want us to call in an APB?

329
00:48:59,256 --> 00:49:00,824
An APB? No, please.

330
00:49:00,924 --> 00:49:03,861
Let's just keep this amongst ourselves.
It's bad enough.

331
00:49:03,961 --> 00:49:06,833
- Did you find anything?
- No, we just started looking.

332
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:13,271
- Look, find him. Tonight.
- Sure.

333
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:15,307
- I'll be in the bar.
- You okay?

334
00:49:16,974 --> 00:49:19,546
Yeah, I'm okay. Sure. Thanks.

335
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:27,985
What you got?

336
00:49:28,085 --> 00:49:31,024
Do you suppose this has anything
to do with anything?

337
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:49,973
- Do you have that money I gave you?
- No, it was in my car.

338
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:52,310
Wayne's deputies must have it by now.

339
00:49:53,812 --> 00:49:58,349
- How are you paying for the gas?
- I have about 80 bucks left.

340
00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:01,187
Great. Can I see your wallet?

341
00:50:22,373 --> 00:50:24,309
I like that better than Lyle.

342
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:28,011
- Where are you going?
- I'm thirsty.

343
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:30,048
I'll be in the bar.

344
00:50:43,795 --> 00:50:47,632
- We should get going.
- You should relax and have a drink.

345
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:49,534
You wanted to get out of here.

346
00:50:49,634 --> 00:50:51,404
What's one drink?

347
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:01,347
- What will you have?
- Give me a beer.

348
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,922
You know...

349
00:51:12,657 --> 00:51:15,460
I realize you didn't
have to come back for me.

350
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,497
You could have just left...

351
00:51:18,663 --> 00:51:20,265
but you didn't...

352
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:23,602
did you?

353
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:28,006
Thank you.

354
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,277
That will be $1.25.

355
00:51:36,781 --> 00:51:38,718
You must think I'm pretty awful.

356
00:51:40,117 --> 00:51:44,855
- Why is that?
- I did ask you to take care of Wayne.

357
00:51:44,955 --> 00:51:46,691
Right.

358
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,230
Under the circumstances,
I can't say as I blame you.

359
00:51:52,797 --> 00:51:54,699
You're a nice guy, aren't you?

360
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:56,234
I try to be.

361
00:52:05,142 --> 00:52:07,378
God, I love tequila.

362
00:52:07,478 --> 00:52:10,881
Maybe that's what we should do:
go to Mexico.

363
00:52:10,981 --> 00:52:13,217
- Ever been there?
- Yeah.

364
00:52:13,317 --> 00:52:15,353
- What's it like?
- Hot.

365
00:52:15,453 --> 00:52:17,757
Sounds perfect.

366
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:23,894
- Let me ask you something.
- Sure.

367
00:52:23,994 --> 00:52:25,430
Why did Wayne try to...

368
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:27,266
- Get rid of me?
- Yeah.

369
00:52:29,266 --> 00:52:30,668
I'll have another shot.

370
00:52:30,768 --> 00:52:32,737
- Tequila?
- Whiskey.

371
00:52:32,837 --> 00:52:34,607
- You got it.
- Thanks.

372
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:40,845
It's all about money.

373
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:43,348
My parents died several years ago
in an accident...

374
00:52:43,448 --> 00:52:46,584
and I received a fairly large
insurance settlement.

375
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:49,121
Wayne's just gotten used to spending it.

376
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:59,029
He probably figures
if he divorced me he'd get nothing.

377
00:52:59,129 --> 00:53:02,032
If I'm six feet under the ground
with a bullet in my head...

378
00:53:02,132 --> 00:53:03,668
he gets to keep everything.

379
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,410
- That's hard to imagine.
- That's my husband.

380
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:27,392
- Hello.
- Wayne, she got away.

381
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:29,727
The cowboy was here.
They got the jump on me.

382
00:53:29,827 --> 00:53:31,896
- Do you know where they went?
- Hell, no. How could I?

383
00:53:31,996 --> 00:53:36,334
I've been staring at my eyelids
for the last hour and a half.

384
00:53:36,434 --> 00:53:38,336
You can't let them get away.

385
00:53:38,436 --> 00:53:42,440
I didn't come all the way up here
to play hide-and-geek.

386
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,343
You have got to find her.

387
00:53:45,443 --> 00:53:48,346
I'll take a look around,
but it's going to cost you.

388
00:53:48,446 --> 00:53:51,849
- I want another five up front.
- Fine.

389
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:53,851
Just find her.

390
00:53:53,951 --> 00:53:56,186
When do I get the money?

391
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:58,356
Tomorrow morning.

392
00:53:58,456 --> 00:54:01,191
Just come to my office.
It's right behind the bar.

393
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:04,564
- What time?
- 9:30.

394
00:54:05,963 --> 00:54:07,399
I'll be there.

395
00:54:13,971 --> 00:54:16,541
What do you say?

396
00:54:16,641 --> 00:54:19,913
You want to go to Mexico with me or what?

397
00:54:21,479 --> 00:54:24,047
In our present condition,
I don't think we'd get far.

398
00:54:24,147 --> 00:54:26,551
What do you think we should do?

399
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:29,219
Get a cup of coffee.

400
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:31,256
I got a better idea.

401
00:54:33,491 --> 00:54:35,026
What's that?

402
00:54:37,595 --> 00:54:39,197
Comfort Inn.

403
00:55:18,803 --> 00:55:21,372
You want to fix me a drink?

404
00:55:21,472 --> 00:55:23,708
Whiskey okay?

405
00:55:23,808 --> 00:55:25,243
Sounds nice.

406
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:39,525
Don't you like me?

407
00:55:43,094 --> 00:55:45,031
Yeah, I like you.

408
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:50,202
Then what's the matter?

409
00:55:53,771 --> 00:55:57,508
Just try to make a point
of staying away from married women.

410
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:02,145
Why? Marriage is just a state of mind.

411
00:56:02,245 --> 00:56:04,348
Not in Texas.

412
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,385
We're not in Texas.

413
00:57:16,754 --> 00:57:18,691
Tell me about Mexico.

414
00:57:23,961 --> 00:57:25,397
Please.

415
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:27,899
Mexico.

416
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:35,406
When I was a kid,
my dad took me to Veracruz...

417
00:57:35,506 --> 00:57:39,410
and he bought me a purple sombrero...

418
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:42,580
and a little guitar.

419
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,349
It was nice.

420
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,820
I'll bet you were a cute little boy.

421
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,356
I don't know.

422
00:57:53,257 --> 00:57:56,196
- We could go there together.
- Yeah?

423
00:57:57,428 --> 00:57:59,664
Get a little house by the ocean.

424
00:57:59,764 --> 00:58:01,999
Drink margaritas all day.

425
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,036
Watch the sun set.

426
00:58:10,274 --> 00:58:12,379
And take siestas together.

427
00:58:14,779 --> 00:58:17,216
Morning, noon and night.

428
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:42,775
You're up early.

429
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:46,646
- I've been thinking.
- About what?

430
00:58:48,212 --> 00:58:49,947
About Mexico.

431
00:58:50,047 --> 00:58:52,986
We'll need more than 80 bucks
to get there.

432
00:58:54,885 --> 00:58:58,456
- We're going to Mexico?
- Yeah.

433
00:58:58,556 --> 00:59:01,792
Wayne always keeps some cash
in a safe at the office.

434
00:59:01,892 --> 00:59:03,662
Wait a minute.

435
00:59:05,563 --> 00:59:08,466
You want to go back to Red Rock?

436
00:59:08,566 --> 00:59:11,302
You have a better idea?

437
00:59:11,402 --> 00:59:15,443
You're just gonna walk into your
husband's bar and take his money?

438
00:59:16,574 --> 00:59:18,009
It's my money.

439
00:59:19,378 --> 00:59:21,347
Your money.

440
00:59:23,914 --> 00:59:26,051
You really think
you can get away with that?

441
00:59:28,586 --> 00:59:30,856
I can't let him have it all.

442
00:59:32,923 --> 00:59:36,761
How much money
are you talking about anyway?

443
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:40,401
Enough. Are you coming?

444
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:01,654
Okay, I'll...

445
01:00:03,287 --> 01:00:04,723
I'll go.

446
01:00:50,868 --> 01:00:52,770
You sure you have the right combination?

447
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,305
Yes.

448
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,814
- Could he have changed it?
- It's possible. Would you like to try?

449
01:01:05,816 --> 01:01:07,251
Right to 24.

450
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,187
Left to 87.

451
01:01:11,956 --> 01:01:13,858
Right to 56.

452
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:15,693
Left to 12.

453
01:01:15,793 --> 01:01:17,730
Right to 99.

454
01:01:25,636 --> 01:01:28,172
- That's it?
- Yeah. Let's go.

455
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:29,742
I can't believe it.

456
01:01:45,256 --> 01:01:46,692
Oh, yeah.

457
01:03:04,268 --> 01:03:05,938
Come in. The door's open.

458
01:03:08,506 --> 01:03:09,941
Good morning, Wayne.

459
01:03:11,942 --> 01:03:13,345
Good morning, fellas.

460
01:03:13,445 --> 01:03:16,515
- What are you boys doing?
- I got a call from the hospital.

461
01:03:16,615 --> 01:03:20,918
One of the nurses was going through
Kurt's clothing. She found this.

462
01:03:21,018 --> 01:03:22,521
How's he doing?

463
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:25,524
He's in critical condition,
but the doctor says he'll make it.

464
01:03:25,624 --> 01:03:28,763
- Talked to him?
- No. He's under heavy sedation.

465
01:03:32,631 --> 01:03:35,536
I called the FBI. They're on their way.

466
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:38,537
$1.9 million.

467
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:42,307
Gotta hand it to you, Wayne.
Or should I call you Kevin?

468
01:03:42,407 --> 01:03:45,477
It's a lot of cash to walk away with.

469
01:03:45,577 --> 01:03:48,646
- Russ, you got that letter?
- Uh-huh.

470
01:03:48,746 --> 01:03:50,683
Came in the mail this morning.

471
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:59,491
"Sheriff of Red Rock,
Wayne Brown may have hired...

472
01:03:59,591 --> 01:04:01,659
a killer to murder his wife.

473
01:04:01,759 --> 01:04:04,329
She is likely to do the same.

474
01:04:04,429 --> 01:04:05,931
This is not a joke."

475
01:04:07,765 --> 01:04:09,233
This is a joke. What's going on?

476
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:12,272
I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

477
01:04:14,772 --> 01:04:18,211
Did you pay that guy from Texas
to murder Suzanne?

478
01:04:19,611 --> 01:04:21,011
This is ridiculous.

479
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:23,847
Was Kurt trying to blackmail you?

480
01:04:23,947 --> 01:04:25,917
- What?
- Is that why you shot him?

481
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:30,555
Did you guys come here to arrest me?

482
01:04:30,655 --> 01:04:33,358
Kind of looks that way.

483
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:35,659
Then go ahead. Arrest me.

484
01:04:35,759 --> 01:04:39,229
I have nothing more to say
until I talk to my lawyer.

485
01:04:39,329 --> 01:04:41,199
Okay, let's go.

486
01:05:03,588 --> 01:05:08,364
"Wanted for the theft of $1.9 million...

487
01:05:09,427 --> 01:05:11,529
from the Benton/Barne Steel Mill.

488
01:05:11,629 --> 01:05:14,865
Kevin and Ann McCord.

489
01:05:14,965 --> 01:05:17,668
May be armed and dangerous."

490
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:22,340
Looks like the only thing
you didn't lie about is your marriage.

491
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,842
It's not what you think. I can explain.

492
01:05:24,942 --> 01:05:27,011
It was Wayne. I had nothing to do with it.

493
01:05:27,111 --> 01:05:29,013
One day he comes home
and says, "Pack your bags."

494
01:05:29,113 --> 01:05:31,849
The next thing I know,
I'm on the FBI's most-wanted list.

495
01:05:31,949 --> 01:05:34,619
What am I supposed to do? He's my husband.

496
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,489
I was in love with him.

497
01:05:37,921 --> 01:05:41,792
There's supposed to be
a half million dollars in that safe.

498
01:05:41,892 --> 01:05:43,827
He must have moved it.

499
01:05:43,927 --> 01:05:46,631
We can find it.

500
01:05:46,731 --> 01:05:49,267
We can be together. We can go to Mexico.

501
01:05:49,367 --> 01:05:51,671
Fuck Mexico!

502
01:05:54,905 --> 01:05:56,508
Michael, please...

503
01:05:57,908 --> 01:05:59,444
don't leave me.

504
01:06:01,011 --> 01:06:02,681
We can be together.

505
01:06:23,768 --> 01:06:25,836
Miss Suzanne...

506
01:06:25,936 --> 01:06:28,839
you're as pretty as advertised.

507
01:06:28,939 --> 01:06:31,043
You look pretty near good enough to eat.

508
01:06:32,577 --> 01:06:34,480
That looks like my gun.

509
01:06:45,557 --> 01:06:47,627
Afternoon, Mike.

510
01:06:50,428 --> 01:06:52,832
Did you have a nice nap?

511
01:06:56,401 --> 01:06:58,536
Did you know that these two...

512
01:06:58,636 --> 01:07:02,139
were a couple of fucking crooks?

513
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:05,410
Yeah. Suzy here says...

514
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:09,581
that Wayne was a bookkeeper
in a steel mill in Illinois...

515
01:07:09,681 --> 01:07:13,518
and he figured out how to walk out
of that plant with $2 million.

516
01:07:13,618 --> 01:07:15,886
And she says...

517
01:07:15,986 --> 01:07:18,856
there's half a million
laying around somewhere...

518
01:07:18,956 --> 01:07:23,160
but that Wayner is the only one
that knows where it is.

519
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:25,465
Now, is that true?

520
01:07:28,766 --> 01:07:30,469
That's what she told me.

521
01:07:33,237 --> 01:07:34,938
If that's the case...

522
01:07:35,038 --> 01:07:37,442
why don't we all go pay Wayner
a little visit...

523
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:40,844
and see if Suzy's story checks out, okay?

524
01:07:40,944 --> 01:07:42,347
But he's in jail.

525
01:07:42,447 --> 01:07:45,786
Not for long, sweetie pie.
Come on. Get up.

526
01:07:56,226 --> 01:07:59,332
Okay, kids, don't you go anywhere.

527
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:01,867
I'll be right back.

528
01:08:11,074 --> 01:08:12,477
I'm really sorry.

529
01:08:12,577 --> 01:08:15,480
You were right.
We shouldn't have come back here.

530
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:19,751
Let's put a cap on the horseshit
and figure a way out of this.

531
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:21,286
Okay?

532
01:08:22,553 --> 01:08:24,823
- Can you get your hands free?
- No.

533
01:08:24,923 --> 01:08:27,659
The cord's so tight, my hands are numb.

534
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,395
Just keep moving them.

535
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:55,286
- Do you still have my car keys?
- I think so. Why?

536
01:08:55,386 --> 01:08:57,656
There's a pocketknife on the key chain.

537
01:09:01,992 --> 01:09:03,428
Well, well, now.

538
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,676
Sheriff's office.

539
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:21,646
Where?

540
01:09:21,746 --> 01:09:23,981
Yeah, we'll be right there.

541
01:09:24,081 --> 01:09:25,817
Matt, that was Bob Finney.

542
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:28,355
He said the old Duncan place is on fire.

543
01:09:32,757 --> 01:09:35,629
Call the volunteers.
I'll get Russ on the radio.

544
01:09:38,529 --> 01:09:40,798
- You want me to go?
- No, you stay put.

545
01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:42,668
I'll call you if I need you.

546
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:57,948
Jeff, it's Ted.

547
01:09:58,048 --> 01:10:01,254
The old Duncan place is on fire,
and we need the volunteers to go there.

548
01:10:08,258 --> 01:10:10,663
Hurry. All right. Bye.

549
01:10:25,743 --> 01:10:28,145
Grady, it's Ted.

550
01:10:28,245 --> 01:10:30,981
Listen. The old Duncan place is on fire.

551
01:10:31,081 --> 01:10:33,651
Yeah, we need some help.

552
01:10:33,751 --> 01:10:35,286
Yeah?

553
01:10:35,386 --> 01:10:38,923
- I'll be right with you.
- Yeah.

554
01:10:39,023 --> 01:10:41,826
Everyone else is already on the way.

555
01:10:41,926 --> 01:10:44,297
Yeah, I'm sure.

556
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:47,432
All right. Okay.

557
01:10:47,532 --> 01:10:49,034
Bye.

558
01:10:50,267 --> 01:10:52,704
Can I help you?

559
01:10:52,804 --> 01:10:54,072
Jesus!

560
01:11:12,122 --> 01:11:14,359
- What happened?
- Nobody knows.

561
01:11:14,459 --> 01:11:16,527
- Anybody inside?
- No.

562
01:11:16,627 --> 01:11:19,196
Wind's not too bad.
We should have this out in no time.

563
01:11:19,296 --> 01:11:22,569
- Does anybody know how it started?
- Not that I know about.

564
01:11:32,977 --> 01:11:35,682
It's turkey. It's one of my favorites.

565
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:47,862
You're in possession of half
a million dollars. Is that right?

566
01:11:50,094 --> 01:11:51,530
Here's the deal.

567
01:11:52,597 --> 01:11:55,666
You can stay here
and go back to Illinois...

568
01:11:55,766 --> 01:11:59,670
or I can get you out of here now
in exchange for half of that money.

569
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:01,205
What's it gonna be?

570
01:12:03,774 --> 01:12:06,511
- All right.
- Half the money, right?

571
01:12:06,611 --> 01:12:08,046
Right.

572
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,216
Just get me out.

573
01:12:12,617 --> 01:12:14,052
Come in, Ted.

574
01:12:17,788 --> 01:12:20,058
Pick up if you read me.

575
01:12:22,126 --> 01:12:25,900
You stay by your radio.
I'm going back to the office.

576
01:12:29,467 --> 01:12:33,203
- You put these on.
- What for?

577
01:12:33,303 --> 01:12:36,641
It's part of the deal.
Come on. We don't got all day.

578
01:12:36,741 --> 01:12:39,413
Take it or leave it.

579
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:52,625
What is this?

580
01:12:54,592 --> 01:12:57,330
Think you're John Wayne?
Put her back in the car.

581
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:04,937
You take Wayne. I'll get Lyle.

582
01:13:09,373 --> 01:13:10,808
You drive.

583
01:13:24,956 --> 01:13:26,826
Smart cop.

584
01:13:43,574 --> 01:13:45,009
Keep it on the road.

585
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,587
God.

586
01:14:00,323 --> 01:14:01,693
Yeah!

587
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:14,607
Come on!

588
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,632
All right!

589
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:58,649
Nice driving! Way to go.

590
01:14:58,749 --> 01:15:01,152
Feels good, don't it?

591
01:15:01,252 --> 01:15:04,989
That old V8 just purrs like a cat.

592
01:15:05,089 --> 01:15:07,461
Yeah.

593
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:10,830
How does it feel?

594
01:15:11,929 --> 01:15:15,001
Happy couple back together again.

595
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:20,140
You two got enough legroom?

596
01:15:28,579 --> 01:15:30,014
Where's the money?

597
01:15:31,615 --> 01:15:33,919
Stay on this road.
I'll tell you when to turn.

598
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,856
Okay, boss.

599
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,463
I just want to ask you one thing.

600
01:15:45,563 --> 01:15:49,934
- How did you ever get to be sheriff?
- I was elected.

601
01:15:50,034 --> 01:15:53,070
No shit. How did you rig that?

602
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:55,942
It wasn't hard. He bought
every voter in the county a drink.

603
01:15:57,174 --> 01:15:58,576
No shit?

604
01:15:58,676 --> 01:16:01,746
Damn. Maybe I ought to do that.

605
01:16:01,846 --> 01:16:03,783
Run for sheriff.

606
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:07,520
Buy a bar.

607
01:16:08,919 --> 01:16:10,856
What do you think?

608
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:15,895
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks.

609
01:16:19,597 --> 01:16:21,132
Scotch ain't good enough?

610
01:16:26,604 --> 01:16:29,208
I knew a guy like you once.

611
01:16:31,776 --> 01:16:34,815
Thought he was better than everybody else.

612
01:16:37,382 --> 01:16:39,318
That's it, ain't it?

613
01:16:44,221 --> 01:16:47,458
You think you're better than me,
don't you?

614
01:16:47,558 --> 01:16:49,260
Why don't you just blow me?

615
01:16:51,896 --> 01:16:57,172
You think you are real hot shit,
don't you?

616
01:17:00,905 --> 01:17:04,344
Cowboy, who's got the gun?

617
01:17:14,051 --> 01:17:16,856
You keep your foot on the gas.

618
01:17:24,929 --> 01:17:26,766
Choose life.

619
01:17:29,099 --> 01:17:31,969
Are we having a good time yet?

620
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:33,838
Forget all these buttons up here.

621
01:17:33,938 --> 01:17:36,375
Just push that down to talk
and let go to listen.

622
01:17:36,475 --> 01:17:37,875
- You got it?
- Yeah.

623
01:17:37,975 --> 01:17:40,278
Good. Don't worry. Len's on his way.

624
01:17:40,378 --> 01:17:43,781
Remember, don't touch anything here
until I get back.

625
01:17:43,881 --> 01:17:47,220
- Okay.
- And, Jane, thanks.

626
01:17:49,387 --> 01:17:51,789
- What happened?
- I don't know. I just missed them.

627
01:17:51,889 --> 01:17:53,991
Come on.

628
01:17:54,091 --> 01:17:58,462
HP is sending backup
from Rawlins and Laramie.

629
01:17:58,562 --> 01:18:02,533
- You take 487 East. I'll go west.
- What are we looking for?

630
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:05,472
A black Buick with Texas plates.

631
01:18:14,879 --> 01:18:18,283
- Now turn off your lights.
- What?

632
01:18:18,383 --> 01:18:21,420
Just turn off your lights
and make that next right up there.

633
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,820
What are we doing?

634
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:27,462
See this house here?
It belongs to the caretaker.

635
01:18:31,695 --> 01:18:34,099
I don't want him to know we're here.

636
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,868
What is this?

637
01:18:37,968 --> 01:18:41,174
This is the last place
anybody would think to look.

638
01:18:44,909 --> 01:18:47,514
Not bad, Wayner.

639
01:19:01,592 --> 01:19:03,894
- You got a shovel?
- In the trunk.

640
01:19:03,994 --> 01:19:08,202
- When do I get these cuffs off?
- When I get the money.

641
01:19:11,035 --> 01:19:13,170
Come on, Mike. Time for some exercise.

642
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:15,506
- Where you gonna dig?
- What do you mean?

643
01:19:15,606 --> 01:19:17,543
It's a big graveyard.

644
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:21,846
What are you saying, Wayne?

645
01:19:21,946 --> 01:19:25,820
Take these cuffs off and I'll point you
in the right direction.

646
01:19:26,884 --> 01:19:29,687
I've been working on the railroad

647
01:19:29,787 --> 01:19:31,657
All the livelong day

648
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:42,902
Can't you dig any faster?

649
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:49,307
You're probably thinking to yourself...

650
01:19:49,407 --> 01:19:52,142
"How did I end up out here
with this bunch of losers?"

651
01:19:52,242 --> 01:19:56,146
Right? I'll tell you how.

652
01:19:56,246 --> 01:19:58,816
'Cause you're a thief.

653
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:02,055
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't, right?

654
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:19,539
What do you want to do with these two?

655
01:20:20,771 --> 01:20:24,578
- We'll let them go.
- Are you sure about that?

656
01:20:26,444 --> 01:20:29,282
There's no point
in killing them now, is there?

657
01:20:30,948 --> 01:20:36,124
I don't know. I don't like loose ends.

658
01:20:55,973 --> 01:20:58,812
I hope you remember the combinations.

659
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:02,646
Yeah, I do.

660
01:21:02,746 --> 01:21:05,918
But I won't open that box
till you get rid of the gun.

661
01:21:09,487 --> 01:21:13,093
- You don't trust me?
- Yeah, I trust you.

662
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:16,060
But, like you said, we're partners.

663
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,097
You have a gun. I don't.

664
01:21:20,164 --> 01:21:22,567
That's my deal. Take it or leave it.

665
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:26,608
What's to keep me from just shooting
the locks off this box?

666
01:21:28,338 --> 01:21:32,444
Or better yet, I shoot you...

667
01:21:32,544 --> 01:21:36,514
and throw the box in the trunk.

668
01:21:36,614 --> 01:21:40,619
You could do that,
but what about the caretaker?

669
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:44,225
He might hear the shot.
He might call the deputies.

670
01:21:45,457 --> 01:21:48,061
Might get a little messy, even for you.

671
01:21:51,128 --> 01:21:55,699
You know, I think you got me all wrong.

672
01:21:55,799 --> 01:21:58,035
I'm not greedy.

673
01:21:58,135 --> 01:22:00,572
Fair is fair. Right, partner?

674
01:22:00,672 --> 01:22:02,540
Right.

675
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,075
All right.

676
01:22:14,486 --> 01:22:15,921
There you go.

677
01:22:18,656 --> 01:22:20,593
Open the box.

678
01:22:42,781 --> 01:22:46,053
Wayne, you're making a mistake.

679
01:22:48,285 --> 01:22:51,755
You really think
he'll let you keep half that money?

680
01:22:51,855 --> 01:22:54,059
Mike, that hurt.

681
01:23:00,765 --> 01:23:02,702
Don't worry about me.

682
01:23:10,809 --> 01:23:12,913
I think he'll let me keep it all.

683
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:18,015
Does this mean that we ain't partners?

684
01:23:18,115 --> 01:23:20,217
Just get away from the car.

685
01:23:20,317 --> 01:23:21,852
Come on.

686
01:23:21,952 --> 01:23:23,388
Move it.

687
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:29,059
All right.

688
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:30,662
Get over there.

689
01:23:33,665 --> 01:23:34,967
Move back.

690
01:23:41,606 --> 01:23:46,009
Come on. You aren't
leaving me out here, are you?

691
01:23:46,109 --> 01:23:50,150
After all I've done for you.
I got you out of jail and everything.

692
01:23:51,915 --> 01:23:55,622
I'll tell you. Human nature.

693
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:03,093
- Who's got the keys?
- I got them right here, partner.

694
01:24:03,193 --> 01:24:05,929
Give them to me.

695
01:24:06,029 --> 01:24:07,766
I'll drive. You just tell me...

696
01:24:07,866 --> 01:24:11,369
Stop moving!
Just slow down, you son of a bitch!

697
01:24:11,469 --> 01:24:13,837
Stay right there!

698
01:24:13,937 --> 01:24:16,508
Now give me the fucking keys!

699
01:24:16,608 --> 01:24:20,949
- Hey, I was just kidding.
- Stop moving!

700
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:26,551
Give me the keys. Come on.

701
01:24:26,651 --> 01:24:29,790
Okay, now. Easy does it.

702
01:24:54,244 --> 01:24:55,679
Sounded like a gun.

703
01:25:20,971 --> 01:25:23,175
- Let me help you.
- Stay away.

704
01:25:24,141 --> 01:25:26,877
- It's okay.
- No.

705
01:25:26,977 --> 01:25:28,580
Give me the gun.

706
01:25:36,521 --> 01:25:38,024
It's okay.

707
01:25:50,468 --> 01:25:52,871
Better call the sheriff.

708
01:25:52,971 --> 01:25:56,878
Where are the keys?
Where the fuck are the keys?

709
01:25:59,276 --> 01:26:01,547
What the fuck did you do with the keys?

710
01:26:14,492 --> 01:26:17,194
All right. I'll let him know.

711
01:26:17,294 --> 01:26:18,730
Thanks.

712
01:26:22,967 --> 01:26:24,369
Hello, Matt?

713
01:26:24,469 --> 01:26:26,203
Come in, Matt.

714
01:26:26,303 --> 01:26:27,705
Go ahead, Jane.

715
01:26:27,805 --> 01:26:30,875
Mrs. Hortijaye just called,
out at the cemetery.

716
01:26:30,975 --> 01:26:33,478
She said there's people out there
shooting guns.

717
01:26:33,578 --> 01:26:35,581
What should I do?

718
01:26:36,748 --> 01:26:39,820
Tell them to stay put.
We'll be right there.

719
01:27:06,944 --> 01:27:08,379
Come back here.

720
01:27:09,781 --> 01:27:12,285
I'm not finished with you.

721
01:27:16,454 --> 01:27:18,356
You know what?

722
01:27:18,456 --> 01:27:20,560
I am better than you.

723
01:28:48,579 --> 01:28:50,014
The train.

724
01:29:38,029 --> 01:29:39,465
Hurry!

725
01:30:14,098 --> 01:30:15,568
Drop the bag!

726
01:30:16,634 --> 01:30:18,704
Then give it to me!

727
01:30:53,471 --> 01:30:57,946
I guess this means you're going
to Mexico by yourself.

728
01:30:59,143 --> 01:31:01,247
There's the door. I suggest you use it.

729
01:31:07,418 --> 01:31:10,557
Is that what you said to the ranch hand?

730
01:31:12,322 --> 01:31:15,626
- You shot him, didn't you?
- Yeah.

731
01:31:15,726 --> 01:31:17,728
Obviously, I didn't do a very good job.

732
01:31:17,828 --> 01:31:20,565
Next time, I'll be more thorough.

733
01:31:20,665 --> 01:31:23,067
- Why?
- He found out about me.

734
01:31:23,167 --> 01:31:24,637
He wanted my money.

735
01:31:25,703 --> 01:31:28,442
That's what it's all about, isn't it?

736
01:31:33,444 --> 01:31:35,548
Stay away from the bag.

737
01:31:41,585 --> 01:31:44,222
I kind of like you.
Don't make me shoot you.

738
01:32:06,977 --> 01:32:09,113
That's right.

739
01:32:09,213 --> 01:32:11,517
No bullets.

740
01:32:20,191 --> 01:32:24,767
Michael, please,
we can work something out.

741
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:28,435
There's enough money for both of us.

742
01:32:31,769 --> 01:32:33,706
I'm really sorry.

743
01:32:35,106 --> 01:32:37,143
I'll give you half.

744
01:32:37,243 --> 01:32:39,264
I'll give you half.

745
01:32:50,621 --> 01:32:52,658
You stupid son of a bitch!

746
01:32:55,726 --> 01:32:57,161
You want it?

747
01:32:58,295 --> 01:32:59,831
Go get it.

748
01:33:07,538 --> 01:33:09,475
You son of a bitch!

749
01:33:21,085 --> 01:33:22,521
Shit.

750
01:33:57,456 --> 01:33:59,560
Adios, Red Rock.
